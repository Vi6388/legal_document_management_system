# Legal Document Management System
Legal Document Management Interface allows users to upload, view, and manage legal documents (PDFs).


Develop a responsive Legal Document Management Interface using ReactJS that allows users to upload, view, and manage legal documents (PDFs). The application should dynamically adjust its layout based on screen size and provide intuitive modals for uploading and viewing 
documents with mock data extractions. Optionally, implement a NodeJS backend to handle file uploads and return mock extraction data.
